# Austin's Portfolio

This portfolio is a React app written entirely with functional components. 
You will not find one class-based component here, and 3rd party ingredients are kept to a minimum.

The two most interesting components are Swipe and Carousel3D.
<br/>

Swipe:
>Makes child elements swipe-able. You can utilize React.useEffect() in another component
to do anything based on 'x' and/or 'y' increasing or decreasing by 1.

Carousel3D:
>Places child elements into a rotating carousel that uses Swipe and smooth CSS transitions.


Feel free to use these however you like! I would love to see your creations/improvements.
