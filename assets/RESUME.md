                "Austin and I work together on a project team which I lead as Product Manager. It only took a few months for me to recommend Austin for the Scrum Champion award. He was always one of the first to raise his hand and ask the question "How can I help?" Austin came to our team as a seasoned and skilled developer. I have had the opportunity and pleasure to watch Austin not only grow his technical skill set but also strengthen his leadership skills. He brings a positive attitude and an open mind. The Bank is super fast paced and Austin has proven his ability to successfully pivot. When issues arise as they always do, he is an integral part of the solution design. I love nicknames and it did not take me long at all to dub him "Showtime!" When the shows starts, Austin is ready to perform."
