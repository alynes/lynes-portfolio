            <p>It was a friend of mine that came up with the idea for this application.
            He is a cryptocurrency day-trader, and was feeling fatigued by the constant need to be at his computer, ready to make a trade.
            He is a self-described "scalper", and uses large percentages of his funds to make profits off of very small price differences.
            The issue with that is that most exchanges, of course, only let you spend the money that you have. They don't have the ability to
            let you spend what you WILL have in the future. So my solution to this was to create an application that allows you to make
            "sequential" trades.</p>
        </div>
